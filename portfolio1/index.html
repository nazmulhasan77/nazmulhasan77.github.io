                        <p>My name is Nazmul Hasan, and I am currently a student pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at Rajshahi University. I reside in the vibrant city of Rajshahi, which has become my second home during my university journey. However, my roots lie in the beautiful town of Rangpur, my hometown, which I hold close to my heart. As a CSE student, I am passionate about the ever-evolving world of technology and software development. When I'm not immersed in coding and coursework, I enjoy exploring new technologies and pursuing various interests. My time at Rajshahi University has been a fulfilling and enriching experience, and I look forward to the exciting adventures that the future holds for me in the world of computer science.
